## Hello Framework - Static "dist" files copied to repo root

In this test, the content of the "dist" folder are moved into the root of a repo.

Test results: Placing the Dist files in the root of the repo broke the formatting:

[model.earth/hello-framework-root](https://model.earth/hello-framework-root)

With this structure, the docs raw content could be integrated with the built dist.  
docs could contain an index.html file with an overview of the source docs.
