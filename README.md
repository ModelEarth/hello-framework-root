# Observable Test - Files in Repo Root

## Hello Framework - Static Files external to folders

In this example, the content of the "dist" folder are moved into the root of a repo.

This allows the static files to reside at the root of the repo.

With this deployment, the docs folder can remain in the same repo and could contain an index.html file with an overview of the source docs.
